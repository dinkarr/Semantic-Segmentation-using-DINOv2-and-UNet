# Semantic-Segmentation-using-DINOv2-and-UNet
Semantic segmentation on Pascal VOC 2012 using a hybrid architecture that combines a pretrained DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a U-Net-style decoder. The model is optimized using Lovasz Softmax Loss for better mIoU and trained with fine-tuning on the last ViT block for efficiency.
